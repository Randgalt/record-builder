# Once Only Assignment

The standard builder generated by RecordBuilder allows components to be assigned and re-assigned.
The `onceOnlyAssignment` option changes this to allow assignment only once. Re-assignment
will throw a `IllegalStateException`.

```java
@RecordBuilder
@RecordBuilder.Options(onceOnlyAssignment = true)
public record MyRecord(char c, int i, String s) {
}
```

Example:

```java
MyRecordBuilder builder = MyRecordBuilder.builder();

// first assignment - OK
builder.s("whatever");

// re-assignment - error
builder.s("another thing");  // will throw `IllegalStateException`
```
